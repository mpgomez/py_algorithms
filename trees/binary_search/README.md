# Binary Search tree
A BST us a binary tree in symmetric order. It is either
* Empty
* Two disjoint binary trees (left and right)

Symmetric order: every node key is:
* Larger than all the keys in the left subtree
* Smaller than all keys in right subtree
This is different from heaps, where we had a node bigger than all children. Here, a node is between the value of its children

####Tree shape
The shape depends on the order in which the keys are added. The best case, it is balanced. The worst, itâ€™s depth is N. Typically, it is somewhere in the middle.
With random keys, it is usually ~twice as deep as a balanced tree. It works similar to the quicksort pivoting.
## Implementation
A BST is a reference to a root node.
```python
class BST:
    def __init__(self):
        self. root = None
        self.size = 0

class BSTNode:
    def __init__(self, key, value, left=None, right=None, parent=None):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.left = parent
```


In our tree we will also need:
put
get
floor(k) bigger key in tree that is smaller or equal than K
delete
make it iterable

### Addition
In order to facilitate other applications, there is a "count" attribute in the node, that will count
how many nodes hang from it.
The size of a tree will just be the count of the root.

### Problematic
We will start having problems when we start doing deletions. If we start inserting/deleting, the tree becomes
more and more unbalances, and instead of logN efficiency, we get square root of N.
Next step would be to look into balanced trees and red black.
